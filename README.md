# AspNet.Security.OpenId.Providers

**AspNet.Security.OpenId.Providers** is a **collection of security middleware** that you can use in your **ASP.NET Core 1.0** application to support OpenID 2.0 authentication providers like **[Steam](http://steampowered.com/)**, **[Wargaming](http://wargaming.net/)** or **[Orange](http://www.orange.fr/)**. It is directly inspired by **[Jerrie Pelser](https://github.com/jerriep)**'s initiative, **[Owin.Security.Providers](https://github.com/RockstarLabs/OwinOAuthProviders)**.

**The latest official release can be found on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/aspnet-contrib) and the nightly builds on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/gallery/aspnet-contrib)**.

## Getting started

**Adding external authentication to your application is a breeze** and just requires a few lines in your `Startup` class:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication()
        .UseSteam()
        .UseOpenId("StackExchange", "StackExchange", options =>
        {
            options.Authority = new Uri("https://openid.stackexchange.com/");
            options.CallbackPath = "/signin-stackexchange";
        });
}
```
