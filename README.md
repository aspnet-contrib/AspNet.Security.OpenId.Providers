# AspNet.Security.OpenId.Providers

**AspNet.Security.OpenId.Providers** is a **collection of security middleware** that you can use in your **ASP.NET Core** application to support OpenID 2.0 authentication providers like **[Steam](https://steampowered.com/)** or **[Wargaming](https://wargaming.net/)**. It is directly inspired by **[Jerrie Pelser](https://github.com/jerriep)**'s initiative, **[Owin.Security.Providers](https://github.com/RockstarLabs/OwinOAuthProviders)**.

**The latest official release can be found on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/aspnet-contrib) and the nightly builds on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/gallery/aspnet-contrib)**.

## Getting started

**Adding external authentication to your application is a breeze** and just requires a few lines in your `Startup` class:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(options => { /* Authentication options */ })
            .AddSteam()
            .AddOpenId("StackExchange", "StackExchange", options =>
            {
                options.Authority = new Uri("https://openid.stackexchange.com/");
                options.CallbackPath = "/signin-stackexchange";
            });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseAuthentication();
}
```

See the [/samples](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OpenId.Providers/tree/dev/samples) directory for a complete sample **using ASP.NET Core MVC and supporting multiple external providers**.
